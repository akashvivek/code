# Trie

### Detail
- Trie is a tree-like data structure used for storing a set or  array where the keys are usually strings.
- It is also called a "prefix tree".
- If two strings have a common prefix then they will have the same ancestor in the trie.
- In a trie, each node represents a single character.
